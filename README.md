# DataStucturesExercises
A series of data structure implementations and exercises based on Sedgewick and Wayne's Algorithms textbook.

The implementations are mostly complete data structures, though are missing some potentially
helpful methods that can be implemented. The exercises contain stripped down versions of these
same data structures, to be used as teaching exercises.
